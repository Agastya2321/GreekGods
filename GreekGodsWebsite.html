            <li>Poseidon was the god of the sea in ancient Greek mythology. According to legend, he was one of the 12 chief gods who lived on Mount Olympus. Poseidon also was said to have a palace under the sea. Poseidonâ€™s main symbols were the dolphin and the trident (a three-pronged spear). The ancient Romans called Poseidon by the name of Neptune.</li>
            <br>
            <li>According to legend, Poseidon was the son of Cronus and Rhea, who were Titans. The Titans were a race of giants who once ruled the world. Poseidon had two brothers, Zeus and Hades. Together they defeated the Titans and took power. Zeus became the supreme ruler on Earth, and Hades became the lord of the underworld. Poseidon became the ruler of the oceans.</li>
